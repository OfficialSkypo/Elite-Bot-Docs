## Toggling the feature

Firstly, you can toggle the feature on using the "/toggle suggestion" command within your guild returning true to enable (or false to disable).

An example of toggling the feature on:

## Configurating the feature

Next, you have to configure the channel to send suggestions to using the "/suggestion channel" command.

An example of configurating the channel:

![img](../static/img/suggestfeaturechannel-example.png)

## Using the feature

Now, users can use the command "/suggest" alongside two inputs title and description which should be included in the suggestion embed.

An example of creating a suggestion:

![img](../static/img/suggestcommand-example.png)

An example of the embed:

![img](../static/img/suggestemebed-example.png)

And... that's it! The suggest system is now fully configured and requires no other configuration.
